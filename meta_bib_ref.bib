abstract = {Objective Written emotional disclosure for 15-20 min a day over 3 to 4 days improves physical and psychological health and may benefit cancer patients. However, no studies have tested the effectiveness of guided writing in cancer patients and their partners. A randomised controlled trial tested whether writing about the patient's diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer using the Guided Disclosure Protocol (GDP) is effective in reducing perceived stress and improving quality of life (QoL) in ovarian cancer couples. The study also tested two theories that may account for beneficial effects of written emotional disclosure, the cognitive processing hypothesis and the social interaction hypothesis. Methods Patients and their partners (N = 102 couples) were randomised to write at home for 15 min a day over 3 days about the patient's diagnosis and treatment using the GDP or what the patient did the previous day (control). Couples were assessed at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-ups on the primary outcomes of perceived stress and QoL and secondary outcomes of intrusive thoughts (testing the cognitive processing hypothesis) and illness-related couple communication (testing the social interaction hypothesis). Results There were no main effects for any outcomes. However, in patients, the GDP improved QoL if illness-related couple communication improved and buffered the effect of intrusive thoughts on perceived stress. Conclusions The GDP might benefit patients in certain circumstances, through changes in communication (in line with the social interaction hypothesis). Further research is needed to determine whether patients benefit from interventions to improve illness-related couple communication and under which conditions.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper examined whether written emotional disclosure reduces psychosis-related post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in a small clinical sample recovering from a first episode of psychosis. METHOD: Approximately 2.5 years after their first episode of psychosis, 22 people completed measures of traumatic symptoms, recovery style, insight, anxiety and depression. Participants then wrote about the most stressful aspects of their illness (N = 12) or about emotionally neutral topics (N = 10) for 15 minutes on three separate occasions. Approximately 5 weeks later, participants re-completed the same dependent measures. RESULTS: Participants who wrote about their psychotic experiences showed less overall severity and avoidance of traumatic symptoms compared with participants who did not write about their psychotic experiences. There were no effects on the other dependent measures. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence with a small clinical sample suggests that providing people who are recovering from a psychotic episode with an opportunity to disclose the most stressful aspects of their illness and treatment may lessen the traumatic impact of these experiences. However, this finding requires replication with a larger sample.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Written expression of traumatic experiences, an intervention found to have health benefits in rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and breast cancer, was tested in a randomized, controlled trial with female fibromyalgia patients. It was hypothesized that relative to controls, patients engaging in the writing intervention would experience improved status on psychological well-being and physical health variables. METHODS: Patients (N = 92) were randomized into a trauma writing group, a control writing group, or usual care control group. The two writing groups wrote in the laboratory for 20 minutes on 3 days at 1-week intervals. Psychological well-being, pain, and fatigue were the primary outcome variables. Assessments were made at pretreatment, posttreatment, 4-month follow-up, and 10-month follow-up. RESULTS: The trauma writing group experienced significant reductions in pain (effect size [ES] = 0.49) and fatigue (ES = 0.62) and better psychological well-being (ES = 0.47) at the 4-month follow-up relative to the control groups. Benefits were not maintained at the 10-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Fibromyalgia patients experienced short-term benefits in psychological and health variables through emotional expression of personal traumatic experiences.},

Participants in both groups received an information booklet one-month post-injury. Participants in the writing group also wrote about emotional aspects of their trauma during three 20-min sessions, five to six weeks post-injury. Psychological assessments were completed within one month and at three and six months post-injury. There were significant improvements on measures of anxiety, depression and PTSD over time. Differences between groups on these measures were not statistically significant. However, subjective ratings of the usefulness of writing were high.

The results (ANCOVAs, regression models) show that at 3 mo. depressive and posttraumatic symptoms were lower in women who performed the expressive writing task than in the neutral writing group. Moreover, the intervention condition was associated significantly with decreased depression at the high and at the mean levels of baseline depression at Time 1. Regarding PTSD, the results showed that the intervention condition was linked significantly to reductions of the symptoms at all levels of baseline PTSD. Mainly, these outcomes suggest that Expressive Writing can be a helpful early and low-cost universal intervention to prevent postpartum distress for women.},

abstract = {We present a first study on a new format of expressive writing assignments for trauma victims with special emphasis on existential thoughts or existentiality. Expressive writing is seen in general as a helpful instrument for coping with trau- matic experiences. Nevertheless, studies on expressive writing in trauma popula- tions have reported both positive and negative effects as well as no effects at all. However, so far, existential aspects of per- sons or their treatment have been widely rejected in the research. The main hypo- thesis of the present study is that a writ- ing instruction that extends to existential thoughts is more effective in terms of reducing PTSD symptoms or depression and bringing about changes in posttrau- matic growth and existential outcomes than the standard instruction. A sample of N = 17 participants was randomly assigned either to the standard instruc- tion (n = 8) or the existentially extended form (n = 9). Both groups were instructed in the same way to undergo four writing sessions lasting for 20 – 30 minutes in each case over a period of two weeks. Outcomes were measured at three time points (pre-treatment, post-treatment and at eight-week follow-up) by question- naires. A trend towards a better effective- ness of the existential writing instruction for trauma symptoms and depression was found. In terms of posttraumatic growth and existential frustration, the results are inconsistent.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to test the effectiveness of expressive writing about irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on disease severity, IBS-related cognition (perceived control over the illness or adaptive cognition), and IBS-specific quality of life.$\backslash$nMETHODS: This was an exploratory pilot study, during which subjects with IBS were asked to write at an online portal for 30 min on 4 consecutive days about their deepest thoughts, emotions, and beliefs regarding the disease and their perception of its effects (writing group). The IBS severity scale (IBSSS), functional bowel disease-related cognition (CG-FBD), catastrophizing/coping (CT3), and IBS-specific quality of life (IBS-QOL) were measured at baseline and at 1 and 3 months' follow-up. Subjects who did not start writing for 3 weeks were asked to complete questionnaires without writing (non-writers group). Within-group comparisons pre- and post-assessment were compared. In addition, the writing and non-writers groups were compared. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the outcome measures over time (1 and 3 months).$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 103 subjects were enrolled in the study (writing group, n=82; non-writers group, n=21). The mean age of all participants was 43 years (s.d. ±12), and the majority (91{\%}) were female. The mean duration of IBS was 6.8 years (s.d. ±3.5); 102 subjects (99‰) had received physician-directed care for the disease. There were no significant differences between the writing and non-writers groups in baseline measurements. For the writing group at 1 and 3 months, the IBSSS improved significantly (+37.4 (±10.8), P=0.0012 and +53.8 (±13), P=0.0002, respectively) and this was not seen in the non-writers group. Similarly, the CG-FBD improved in the writing group by 0.58 (±0.2, P=0.006) at 3 months, although the changes in IBS–QOL did not reach clinical or statistical significance.$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study, expressive writing improved IBS disease severity and cognition in subjects with longer-term duration of the disease. A large, controlled study is warranted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this novel modality for adjunctive management of IBS in the outpatient setting.},

abstract = {Trait negative emotion has been identified as a potential moderator of the effect of expressive writing on symptoms of posttraumatic stress. The goal of this study was to investigate whether individuals who differed in degree of trait negative emotion (high vs. low) responded differently to three different writing tasks. These tasks included an expressive writing condition in which participants wrote about a traumatic event, an active control condition in which participants wrote about a traumatic event in a nonemotional manner, and a control condition in which participants wrote about daily activities. One hundred twenty undergraduates completed one of these writing tasks for 30 minutes on two consecutive days. Results revealed that participants high in trait negative emotion endorsed significantly greater symptoms of posttraumatic stress and emotional arousal than participants low in trait negative emotion, regardless of writing condition. Results further showed a significant reduction in posttraumatic stress symptoms among high trait negative emotion individuals assigned to the expressive writing condition but no significant reduction in other conditions. Participants high in trait negative emotion also rated the writing task as significantly more difficult and distressing than participants low in trait negative emotion; nonetheless, both groups indicated that the task was equally helpful.

abstract = {The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the possible positive effects of the Expressive Writing paradigm on a sample of Romanian female cancer patients. The major tenet of this paradigm is that if individuals with high levels of distress express in writing, for three or four consecutive writing sessions, their deepest thoughts and emotions regarding the activating event and its consequences, on the follow-up assessment they would experience significantly lower levels of distress, and improved physical and/or psychological functioning. Our study has evinced, that the participants of the sample we investigated has experienced at the follow-up assessment significantly lower levels of distress, and significantly higher levels of positive meaning in life and benefit finding, however, the results may depend on the pre-intervention levels of depression. Nevertheless, the Expressive Writing task has not significantly contributed in our sample to the enhancement of the levels of positive emotions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Research suggests that many sexual assault survivors do not disclose their experience, which may increase associated distress. Pennebaker's emotional disclosure paradigm has been shown to ameliorate psychological and physical distress in individuals exposed to stressful events. The current study assessed the effectiveness of this paradigm with sexual assault survivors (N = 74). College women with a history of sexual assault wrote about their most severe victimization or about how they spend their time (control). Then 73 women (98.6{\%}) completed a 1-month follow-up assessment. Results indicated that across writing sessions, the disclosure group reported greater reductions in negative mood immediately post-writing. However, both groups showed significant reductions in physical complaints, psychological distress, and traumatic stress symptoms at the 1-month follow-up, suggesting no added benefit to disclosure of a sexual assault using a brief written paradigm.

abstract = {Writing about a personal stressful event has been found to have psychological and physical health benefits, especially when physiological response increases during writing. Response training was developed to amplify appropriate physiological reactivity in imagery exposure. The present study examined whether response training enhances the benefits of written emotional disclosure. Participants were assigned to either a written emotional disclosure condition (n= 113) or a neutral writing condition (n= 133). Participants in each condition wrote for 20 minutes on 3 occasions and received response training (n= 79), stimulus training (n= 84) or no training (n= 83). Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded throughout a 10-minute baseline, 20-minute writing, and a 10-minute recovery period. Self-reported emotion was assessed in each session. One month after completing the sessions, participants completed follow-up assessments of psychological and physical health outcomes. Emotional disclosure elicited greater physiological reactivity and self-reported emotion than neutral writing. Response training amplified physiological reactivity to emotional disclosure. Greater heart rate during emotional disclosure was associated with the greatest reductions in event-related distress, depression, and physical illness symptoms at follow-up, especially among response trained participants. Results support an exposure explanation of emotional disclosure effects and are the first to demonstrate that response training facilitates emotional processing and may be a beneficial adjunct to written emotional disclosure. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Previous research has indicated that a single session of emotional disclosure related to a stressful experience can foster the development of posttraumatic growth (PTG); however, others have suggested that perceived growth may serve as a coping mechanism after being reminded of a stressful event. At the same time, theories of posttraumatic growth suggest that there may be both a genuine and an illusionary function of PTG. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the validity of postwriting PTG by measuring growth immediately before and after a disclosure task, as elevations in perceived PTG immediately following the task may indicate that growth was simply being used to cope. Participants were 90 undergraduates from a private, Midwestern university that completed either an emotional written disclosure task or a control task and reported perceived levels of PTG. Results suggest no significant increases in reported growth regardless of condition. Post hoc analyses revealed participants in the emotional disclosure did experience elevated levels of distress, but did not report increased growth. These results fail to support the hypothesis that self-reported growth after expressive writing tasks is merely an illusory coping response.},

abstract = {Salutary effects of writing about trauma on health are well documented, but little research has directly examined the underlying mechanisms by which these effects occur. The principal study in this article assessed the potential underlying mechanism of meaning-making, defined as changing situational meaning (appraisals of the traumatic experience) and global meaning (world views, personality, and coping styles) in order to reduce the discrepancy between global and situational meaning. Forty-one trauma-writing participants and 21 nontrauma-writing control participants completed 4 days of writing and a 4 month follow-up. Decrements in health were noted for the control group but not for the trauma-writing group. Over time, the trauma-writing group's appraisals changed to reflect less aversive situational meaning (e.g., less stressful, less threatening), and their cognitive processing, reflected by intrusions and avoidance, decreased. Less stressful appraisals and reduced cognitive processing were related to improved health outcomes. Results indicate that writing about trauma facilitates the making of meaning. A second study examined whether scores on several measures used in the first study changed across 4 months without a writing intervention. It was found that these measures did not change across time. has yielded a number of interesting and even provocative findings.

abstract = {Abstract In recent years, the supermarket industry has become increasingly competitive. One outcome has been the proliferation of a variety of pricing formats, and considerable debate among academics and practitioners about how these formats affect consumers' store choice behavior. This paper advances the idea that consumer shopping behavior (as defined by average size of the shopping basket and the frequency of store visits) is an important determinant of the store choice decision when stores offer different price formats. A recent Wall Street Journal article that summarized the result of Bruno's management switching the chain from EDLP to HILO illustrates the importance of this issue: "The company's priceconscious customers, used to shopping for a fixed basket of goods, stayed away in droves." Thus, the audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who wish to understand store choices or predict how a change in price format might affect store profitability and the mix of clientele that shop there.This paper attempts to understand the relationship between grocery shopping behavior, retail price format, and store choice by posing and answering the following questions. First, after controlling for other factors (e.g., distance to the store, prior experience in the store, advertised specials), do consumer expectations about prices for a basket of grocery products ("expected basket attractiveness") influence the store choice decision? This is a fairly straightforward test of the effect of price expectations on store choice. Second, are different pricing formats (EDLP or HILO) more or less attractive to different types of shoppers? To adequately answer the second question, we must link consumers' category purchase decisions, which collectively define the market basket, and the store choice decision.We study the research questions using two complementary approaches. First, we develop a stylized theory of consumer shopping behavior under price uncert... [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Research on emotional disclosure should test the effects of different disclosure methods and whether symptoms are affected differently than post-traumatic growth. We randomized 214 participants with unresolved stressful experiences to four disclosure conditions (written, private spoken, talking to a passive listener, talking to an active facilitator) or two control conditions. All groups had one 30-minute session. After 6 weeks, disclosure groups reported more post-traumatic growth than controls, and disclosure conditions were similar in this effect. All groups decreased in stress symptoms (intrusions, avoidance, psychological and physical symptoms), but disclosure did not differ from control. We conclude that 30 minutes of disclosure leads to post-traumatic growth but not necessarily symptom reduction, and various disclosure methods have similar effects. Research on the effects of disclosure should focus on the benefits of growth as well as symptom reduction. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Psychol 00:1-15, 2010.},

abstract = {There is a need to identify alternative treatment options for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), especially among veterans where PTSD tends to be more difficult to treat and dropout rates are especially high. One potential alternative is written exposure therapy, a brief intervention shown to treat PTSD among civilians effectively. This study investigated the feasibility and tolerability of written exposure therapy in an uncontrolled trial with a sample of 7 male veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Findings indicated that written exposure therapy was well tolerated and well received. Only 1 of the 7 veterans dropped out of treatment, no adverse events occurred during the course of treatment, and veterans provided high treatment satisfaction ratings. Clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptom severity were observed for 4 veterans at posttreatment and 6 veterans at the 3-month follow up. Moreover, 5 of the 7 veterans no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD 3 months following treatment. These findings suggest that written exposure therapy holds promise as a brief, well tolerated treatment for veterans with PTSD. However, additional research using randomized controlled trial methodology is needed to confirm its efficacy. To},

Participants were 46 adults with a current primary diagnosis of motor vehicle accident-related PTSD. Participants were randomly assigned to either WET or a waitlist (WL) condition. Independent assessments took place at baseline and 6-, 18-, and 30-weeks post baseline (WL condition not assessed at 30 weeks). Participants assigned to WET showed significant reductions in PTSD symptom severity at 6- and 18-week post-baseline, relative to WL participants, with large between-group effect sizes. In addition, significantly fewer WET participants met diagnostic criteria for PTSD at both the 6- and 18-week post-baseline assessments, relative to WL participants. Treatment gains were maintained for the WET participants at the 30-week post baseline assessment. Notably, only 9{\%} of participants dropped out of WET and the WET participants reported a high degree of satisfaction with the treatment.

abstract = {Importance Written exposure therapy (WET), a 5-session intervention, has been shown to efficaciously treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, this treatment has not yet been directly compared with a first-line PTSD treatment such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Objective To determine if WET is noninferior to CPT in patients with PTSD. Design, Setting, and Participants In this randomized clinical trial conducted at a Veterans Affairs medical facility between February 28, 2013, and November 6, 2016, 126 veteran and nonveteran adults were randomized to either WET or CPT. Inclusion criteria were a primary diagnosis of PTSD and stable medication therapy. Exclusion criteria included current psychotherapy for PTSD, high risk of suicide, diagnosis of psychosis, and unstable bipolar illness. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Interventions Participants assigned to CPT (n = 63) received 12 sessions and participants assigned to WET (n = 63) received 5 sessions. The CPT protocol that includes written accounts was delivered individually in 60-minute weekly sessions. The first WET session requires 60 minutes while the remaining 4 sessions require 40 minutes. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the total score on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale forDSM-5; noninferiority was defined by a score of 10 points. Blinded evaluations were conducted at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks after the first treatment session. Treatment dropout was also examined. Results For the 126 participants (66 men and 60 women; mean [SD] age, 43.9 [14.6] years), improvements in PTSD symptoms in the WET condition were noninferior to improvements in the CPT condition at each of the assessment periods. The largest difference between treatments was observed at the 24-week assessment (mean difference, 4.31 points; 95{\%} CI, –1.37 to 9.99). There were significantly fewer dropouts in the WET vs CPT condition (4 [6.4{\%}] vs 25 [39.7{\%}]; $\chi$21 = 12.84, Cramer V = 0.40). Conclusions and Relevance Although WET involves fewer sessions, it was noninferior to CPT in reducing symptoms of PTSD. The findings suggest that WET is an efficacious and efficient PTSD treatment that may reduce attrition and transcend previously observed barriers to PTSD treatment for both patients and providers.

As part of a larger study, participants ( N = 71) with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) wrote about traumatic experiences for 20 min on three consecutive days. Alexithymia, denial, behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement, focus on/venting of emotions, avoidant thoughts, and health status were assessed at baseline, health status again 4 months after writing. Essays were coded for how personal and how emotional they were, and for narrative structure. Non-expression and cognitive avoidance were neither related to how personal or emotional essays were, nor to affective response to writing. High levels of denial or avoidant thoughts predicted less narrative structure. Avoidant thinking marginally predicted health improvements in RA patients. Results suggest that non-expression and cognitive avoidance do not interfere with writing in terms of emotional engagement, but may influence narrative use.},

There is evidence that individuals experiencing natural disasters are at risk for long term physical and mental health problems, particularly if experiencing unbidden thoughts (intrusions) about the disaster. This study examined if a brief, easily administered, structured writing task (expressing thoughts and emotions about the natural disaster) would attenuate the relationship between intrusions about the disaster and both negative affect and physical symptoms. 53 individuals recently displaced by a hurricane and subsequent flooding were randomly assigned to the experimental (emotional writing) group or to the control (neutral writing) group. A community reference group of 56 non-displaced adults was also obtained. In the control group, disaster-related intrusions more than 3 mo post-disaster were associated with higher levels of negative affect and more physical symptoms. In the experimental group, disaster-related intrusions were unrelated to both negative affect and physical symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Methods: Fifty-nine patients were recruited (mean age, 50 years; 32 men and 27 women; mean length of diagnosis, 22 years). Individuals were randomly assigned to receive ED intervention or standard control writing intervention. Disease severity, quality of life, and mood were assessed at baseline and at 2, 8, and 12 weeks postintervention. Results: Disease severity and quality of life improved in both groups over the follow-up period. Preliminary analysis suggested no differences in the magnitude of improvement between the groups. However, predictors of improvement were found to differ. Disease severity on Week 12 was predicted by changes in mood in intervention patients and seasonal variation in control patients. In contrast, quality of life on Week 12 was predicted by baseline quality of life in intervention patients, while seasonal variation approached significance for control patients. Conclusions: Changes in mood following ED predicted improvements in disease severity in patients with psoriasis. However, the degree of improvement did not differ between intervention and control patients. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility of using an emotional expression intervention with patients with cancer and test the hypothesis that emotional expression improves psychosocial adjustment. DESIGN: Sequentially randomized pretest/post-test design with repeated measures. SETTING: Two radiation therapy (RT) facilities. SAMPLE: Women completing RT for stage I or II breast cancer, who spoke and read English, were independent in self-care, and provided written consent. Subjects (N = 44) were middle-aged (mean = 53.6 years), Caucasian, married, and well educated. METHODS: Following a baseline interview, subjects were sequentially randomized to an attentional control group, a single dose, or a three-dose emotional expression writing group. Interventions were administered at the time of completion of RT. Follow-up telephone interviews were completed at 1, 4-6, 16, and 28 weeks post-RT. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Positive and negative affect, intrusiveness of thoughts, use of avoidant coping, side effect severity, trait negative affectivity, content of written essay, and themes derived from content analysis. FINDINGS: A high level of acceptance and completion of emotional expression existed, but no effect of the intervention on psychosocial adjustment was evident. Process measures in the three-dose group changed as expected. No relationship existed between content changes and outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional expression is feasible for patients with cancer, but the efficacy of the intervention in improving mood and decreasing cognitive intrusion and avoidance was not supported. Emotional expression processes were consistent with those seen in other samples and may influence outcomes that were not addressed in this study. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: More extensive testing is needed, including additional outcome variables. Essays reveal concerns around communication, recurrence, and health behavior changes that should be considered in practice.},
